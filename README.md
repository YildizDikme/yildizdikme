# üí´ About Me:
<br>Hello!<br><br>I am passionate about frontend development and enjoy sharing my projects on various platforms. I actively share my projects on platforms like LinkedIn, YouTube, and GitHub, aiming to contribute to the community and learn from others. I believe that by sharing our experiences, we can enhance our software development skills.<br><br>Over the past two years, I have been continuously improving myself as a frontend developer. During this time, I have had the opportunity to work with HTML, CSS, SCSS, SASS, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React. I have been particularly focusing on React projects recently to further advance my skills. Additionally, I have an interest in Angular.js and Vue.js as well, among other libraries<br><br>I give great importance to staying updated on UI/UX trends. I continuously follow developments in the design world to maximize the user experience and translate these trends into my coding practices, adhering to the principle of "from design to code."<br><br>What matters to me is developing user-friendly and impactful web applications that bring value to my projects. I am always open to self-improvement and learning new things.
